Project samples of my skills in tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, Microsoft Project, SAP Ariba, SAP (PP/SD/MM) modules and continuous improvement techniques.
In my previous roles, I worked extensively in these areas, but I did not have access to data I could showcase.
To give a better sense of my capabilities, I’ve attached the work outside of work experience I currently have available:

* An Excel work from my spreadsheet modeling course (note: there are 20 sheets within)
* A Power BI project where I analyzed over 30,000 rows of shipment data (file attached: sample-shipments-data-all-Apr-2025.xlsx) and created a dashboard (PDF attached)
* Lean six sigma green belt where I deepened my expertise in different root cause analysis techniques and continuous improvement.
* Completed SAP Ariba certification from University (attached), I also worked on SAP (PP/SD/MM) practice exercises from my coursework, and I’m happy to share them as well if that would be helpful.
* Microsoft Project certification
* A SQL project I completed on DataCamp: https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/492a6434-bf16-462b-a69e-e0e6f89935b3/edit
