* A SQL project I completed on DataCamp: https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/492a6434-bf16-462b-a69e-e0e6f89935b3/edit
* A Power BI project where I analyzed over 30,000 rows of shipment data (file attached: sample-shipments-data-all-Apr-2025.xlsx) and created a dashboard (PDF attached)

          [ Developed an interactive Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to analyze product performance, shipment distribution, and regional sales trends.
          Data Cleaning & Transformation: Imported raw shipment data from Excel and performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
          Data Modeling: Designed a relational data model connecting tables such as products, salespersons, shipments, and locations to enable dynamic cross-filtering.
          DAX Implementation: Created calculated columns and measures using DAX formulas to compute KPIs like Total Profit, Profit %, Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons, and Previous Year projections.
          Visualization: Built insightful visuals including KPI cards, trend charts, and geo distribution maps to track key metrics such as total revenue, shipment count, and product-wise profitability.
          Insights: Identified top-performing regions, best-selling products, and high-profit salespersons to support strategic decision-making.]
